Pacman game in plain Javascript. Thanks to Adam Alinauskas https://github.com/AdamAlinauskas for the tutorial and training video. Made this game for my 7 year old son to get him interested in programming. He modified the tile map to create the game visual he wanted with wall design, number of ghosts and power ups.
